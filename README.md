My attempt at recreating Google's homepage. 
The links don't go anywhere and it doesn't look perfect but for a first attempt I'm quite happy with it.
Most of this was just applying properties to different sections, e.g. making the backgrounds at the bottom grey or positioning the logo and search bar.
